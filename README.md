# LAMMPS_Workflow
Python Automation of LAMMPS Workflow
https://www.lammps.org/

The MEAM_workflow directory determines various thermodynamic and structural properties of an interatomic potential file

MEAM_workflow structure:
Workflow_job calls the MEAM_prop.py python script, which takes care of calling all the lammps scripts and calculating 
the resulting values

This is an older version of the workflow, new version has various updates to structure and features but code will remain private
